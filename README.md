### Hi there 👋

<img src="manon.PNG" alt="Manon works" />

I'm Manon, I'm 24, and I'm new to web development and coding. Now that I finished my web development formation with O'Clock (a great full-remote school!), I'm looking for a job while I develop my own website (repo : Front-Portfolio) with React. You can also take a look at my Memescalibur repositories and small projects I add week after week.
