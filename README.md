### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Working mnou banner](manon.PNG)

Welcome on my Github page ! Wanna learn a little more about me ? Well, I'm Manon, I'm 25, I live in France but dream about living somewhere else in the world to discover new landscapes and cultures. I'm a dog person, but I only have cats. I listen to a lot of different music styles but my favorites are pop, electro pop, but I also like rap, classic, and rock. I also love movies soundtracks. Ok let's be clear : I love music. I'm a video games addict, if I were a Twitch streamer I'd probably be the only one streaming Destiny "let's play" ! Oh. And I'm a web developer.
